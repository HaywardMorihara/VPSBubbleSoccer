# VPS Bubble Soccer
Bubble soccer game using Phaser.js, based on Workday's VPS team outing experience.

### Getting Started:
*Prereqs: You need git and python installed on your computer*

Clone this repository. Then run:
```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
to start the local server.
Then, open the browser and go to `localhost:8000` to play the game!

#### Controls:
Only two player is enabled on all computers and browsers. The red player uses WASD and the blue plyaer uses the arrows.

Currently, you can only player 4 players if:
- You are playing on a Mac
- You're using Firefox as your browser
- You have 4 Gamecube Controllers and a USB adapter for them

Hopefully will add more flexible controller support soon!
